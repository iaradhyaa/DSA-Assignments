🧮 Array Assignments

No.| 🧠 Question| 📄 File Name| 📝 Description
1️⃣| Find the minimum value in an array| "Q1_Minimum_Value.c" (Q1_Minimum_Value.c)| Program to find the smallest element in an array
2️⃣| Find the second largest element in an array| "Q2_Second_Largest_Element.c" (Q2_Second_Largest_Element.c)| Finds and prints the second largest number
3️⃣| Find the second minimum value in an array| "Q3_Second_Minimum_Value.c" (Q3_Second_Minimum_Value.c)| Finds the second smallest element
4️⃣| Determine the positions of elements in a 2D array| "Q4_Position_in_2D_Array.c" (Q4_Position_in_2D_Array.c)| Displays row and column positions of elements
