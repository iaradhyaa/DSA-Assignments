# 🌻 DSA-Assignments

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignments, completed as part of the BCA (Artificial Intelligence). Each program is implemented in the C language and demonstrates core algorithmic techniques, efficient data handling, and logical problem-solving approaches fundamental to computer science.

## 📂 Assignments Included

### ⭐ Assignment 1: Array and Matrix Fundamentals

A collection of problems focusing on array manipulation and basic matrix operations.

* **Finding the Minimum Value** : Implementation to efficiently locate the smallest element in an array.
* *Finding the Second Minimum Value* : Logic to find the second smallest unique element.
* *Array Rotation* : Implementation of various array rotation techniques (e.g., left/right rotation).
* *Matrix Operations* : Basic operations on 2D arrays (matrices).
* *Finding the Second Largest Value* : Implementation to efficiently locate the second largest element in an array.

### ⚡ Assignment 2: Sorting and Searching Algorithms

Implementation of key searching and sorting algorithms.

* *Selection Sort* : Step-by-step implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
* *Quick Sort* : Efficient implementation of the divide-and-conquer Quick Sort algorithm.
* *Binary Search* : Implementation of the search algorithm for sorted arrays.
* *Linear Search* : Simple and direct implementation of the sequential search.
* *Bubble Sort* : Simple comparison-based algorithm repeatedly swaps adjacent elements until sorted.
