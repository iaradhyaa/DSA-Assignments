# 🌻 DSA-Assignments

🌸 DSA Assignments – Aradhya Mishra

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignments, completed as part of the BCA (Artificial Intelligence). Each program is implemented in the C language and demonstrates core algorithmic techniques, efficient data handling, and logical problem-solving approaches fundamental to computer science.

## 📂 Assignments Included

### ⭐ Assignment 1: Array and Matrix Fundamentals

A collection of problems focusing on array manipulation and basic matrix operations.

* *Finding the Minimum Value:* Implementation to efficiently locate the smallest element in an array.
* *Finding the Second Minimum Value:* Logic to find the second smallest unique element.
* *Array Rotation:* Implementation of various array rotation techniques (e.g., left/right rotation).
* *Matrix Operations:* Basic operations on 2D arrays (matrices).

### ⚡ Assignment 2: Sorting and Searching Algorithms

Implementation of key searching and sorting algorithms.

* *Selection Sort:* Step-by-step implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
* *Quick Sort:* Efficient implementation of the divide-and-conquer Quick Sort algorithm.
* *Binary Search:* Implementation of the search algorithm for sorted arrays.
* *Linear Search:* Simple and direct implementation of the sequential search.
